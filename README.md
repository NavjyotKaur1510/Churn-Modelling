# Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning
A deep learning model built using Keras to predict customer churn for a bank. The model analyzes customer demographics, account details, and behavior patterns to identify customers likely to leave.

*Model Overview*
Multi-layer neural network with ReLU activation
Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
Sigmoid activation in the output layer for binary classification
*Technologies Used*
Python – Scripting and data handling
Keras – Deep learning model
NumPy, Pandas – Data preprocessing
Scikit-learn – Feature scaling & evaluation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
